# Image-Classification-with-CNN
This project performs image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It explores different approaches including:

  - VGG16 transfer learning
  - Data augmentation to improve generalization
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting

The main workflow is controlled via Jupyter notebooks, allowing you to train, evaluate, and visualize different models.
